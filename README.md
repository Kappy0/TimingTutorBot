# TimingTutorBot
A Discord bot for my server, Kappy Kountry (https://discord.gg/dEhnHVE). Uses discord.js and node-fetch to post announcements when I'm live on Twitch.

(other modules/functionality to be added as I see fit)

Currently, other functionality includes...

- Using mysql to connect to a MySQL database to record guesses made for an event during my 2021 Birthday Stream.
